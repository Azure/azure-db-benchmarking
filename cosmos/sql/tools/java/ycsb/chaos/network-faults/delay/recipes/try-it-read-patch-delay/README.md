# Mixed(Read & Patch) workload with network Delay

This recipe encapsulates a read and patch workload that executes for 20-25 minutes. Around 5 minutes into the execution a network latency is simulated by introducing the specified netork delay on all the packets bound to the specified region. 

## Recipe definition 

|  Config   |  Value   |
| --- | --- |
| Database | Cosmos SQL API |
| Benchmarking tool | YCSB |
| Workload | Read & Patch (80:20) |
| Max RPS | 50 |
| Duration | 20-25 minutes |
| Fault Type | Packet Drop |
| Fault Start | 5 Minutes after the workload starts |
| Fault duration | 5 minutes |
| Number of documents in DB | 30 |
| Document Size | â‰ˆ1 KB(YCSB default) |

## Execute
1. Create a [Cosmos DB SQL API account and container](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/nosql/quickstart-portal)

   |  Setting   |  value  | 
   | --- | --- | 
   | Multi-region Writes | enable |  
   | Database Name | ycsb | 
   | Container Name | usertable | 
   | Partition Key  | /id |
   | Container Throughput Type | Manual |  
   | Container throughput | 400 RU/s[^1] |

3. Create a [storage account](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-account-create?tabs=azure-portal) 
4. Create a [resource group](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/manage-resource-groups-portal) in the same region as the Cosmos DB account 
5. Click the deploy to Azure button and fill in the following missing parameter values:

   |  Parameter   |  Value  |
   | --- | --- |
   | Resource group | name of the resource group from step 3 |
   | Region | Make sure the region is the same as the Cosmos DB account primary region |
   | Results Storage Connection String | connection string of the storage account from step 2 |
   | Cosmos URI  | URI of the Cosmos DB account from step 1 |
   | Cosmos Key  | Primary key of the Cosmos DB account from step 1 |
   | Admin Password | Admin account password for the VM |
   | Preferred Region List | Comma separated preferred regions list. Ex: South Central US,East US. [More about SDKs Failover configuration](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/nosql/troubleshoot-sdk-availability) |
   | faultRegion | Region which should experience the fault. Ex: South Central US |
   | waitForFaultToStartInSec | Time in seconds to wait before starting the fault |
   | durationOfFaultInSec| Duration of the fault in seconds |

[![Deploy to Azure](https://aka.ms/deploytoazurebutton)](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FAzure%2Fazure-db-benchmarking%2Fusers%2Fnakumars%2FdrCapablity%2Fcosmos%2Fsql%2Ftools%2Fjava%2Fycsb%2Fchaos%2Fnetwork-faults%2Fdelay%2Frecipes%2Ftry-it-read-patch-delay%2Fazuredeploy.json)


## Output
You can visualize the total request count by region by creating a Azure Monitor metrics chart for Azure Cosmos DB. You will initially see the requests going to the first region in the "Preferred Regions List" before the requests getting routed to the next available region in the "Preferred Regions List" assuming that the fault is active in the first region and the account is configured for multi-master.
