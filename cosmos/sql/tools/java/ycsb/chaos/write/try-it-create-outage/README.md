# Create workload with network outage

This recipe encapsulates a create only workload that lasts for 20-25 minutes. Around 5 minutes into the execution a regional outage is simulated by dropping all the packets bound to the specified region. The client/SDK marks the region as unavailable for writes and retries the create operations on the next available region if "Multi-region Writes" is enabled for the account. For accounts with "Multi-region Writes" disabled the create operations fail. Once the packet drops end, approximately in 5 minutes, all the requests get routed to the primary region.

## Execute
1. Create a [Cosmos DB SQL API account and container](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/nosql/quickstart-portal)

   |  Setting   |  value  | 
   | --- | --- |
   | Multi-region Writes | enable |  
   | Database Name | ycsb | 
   | Container Name | usertable | 
   | Partition Key  | /id |
   | Container Throughput Type | Manual |  
   | Container throughput | 400 RU/s |

2. Create a [storage account](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-account-create?tabs=azure-portal) 
3. Create a [resource group](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/manage-resource-groups-portal) in the same region as the Cosmos DB account 
4. Click the deploy to Azure button and fill in the following missing parameter values:

   |  Parameter   |  Value  |
   | --- | --- |
   | Resource group | name of the resource group from step 3 |
   | Region | Make sure the region is the same as the Cosmos DB Account Primary region |
   | Results Storage Connection String | connection string of the storage account from step 2 |
   | Cosmos URI  | URI of the Cosmos DB account from step 1 |
   | Cosmos Key  | Primary key of the Cosmos DB account from step 1 |
   | Admin Password | Admin account password for the VM |
   | Preferred Region List | Comma separated preferred regions list. Ex: South Central US,East US |
   | faultRegion | Primary region. Ex: South Central US |
