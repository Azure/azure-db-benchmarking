# 300 mixed operations Per Second

This recipe encapsulates a read and patch workload that lasts for 20-25 minutes. Around 5 minutes into the execution a regional outage is simulated by dropping all the packets bound to the specified region. The client/SDK detects the outage, marks the region as unavailable for reads and retries the read requests on the next available region. The client/SDK also marks the region as unavailable for writes and retries the patch operations on the next available region if "Multi-region Writes" is enabled for the account. For accounts with "Multi-region Writes" is disabled the patch operations fail. Once the packet drops end, approximately in 5 minutes, all the requests get routed to the primary region.

   | Container throughput | 400 RU/s[^1] |

3. Create a [storage account](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-account-create?tabs=azure-portal) 
4. Create a [resource group](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/manage-resource-groups-portal) in the same region as the Cosmos DB account 
5. Click the deploy to Azure button and fill in the following missing parameter values:

   |  Parameter   |  Value  |
   | --- | --- |
   | Resource group | name of the resource group from step 3 |
   | Region | Make sure the region is the same as the Cosmos DB account region |
   | Results Storage Connection String | connection string of the storage account from step 2 |
   | Cosmos URI  | URI of the Cosmos DB account from step 1 |
   | Cosmos Key  | Primary key of the Cosmos DB account from step 1 |
   | Admin Password | Admin account password for the VM |
   | Preferred Region List | Comma separated preferred regions list. ex: South Central US,East US |
   | faultRegion | Primary region. ex: South Central US |
